# react-apollo-link-state-redux-example

A React application using Apollo Client with [apollo-link-state](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/state.html) and Redux **side by side** for local state management. While Redux is used to manage selected items in a list as local data, the remaining queries and mutations from Apollo Client are used for remote data.
